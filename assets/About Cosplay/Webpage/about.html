                                <p>My hobbits are swimming and cosplay. I have swum since primary 3. When I swim, I feel relaxed and free. Moreover, I can keep fit by swimming and have a chance to wear various beautiful bikinis. On the other hand, I like cosplay too. It is not just because I can makeup myself beautifully, but also I can make friends with the same hobbit as me. In a short conclusion, cosplay brings both joy and friends to me.</p>
                                
<p>Apart from swimming and cosplay, I like traveling and taking photos. I am always interested to visit diversified culture of countries. In addition, photography is one of the best the to capture wondrous moment. I use to bring along my camera when I am traveling. </p>
                               
                                <p>Talking about my hobbits, I am going to talk about my favorites next, which are K-POP and ACG. My favorite K-POP idols are NU'EST and SEVENTEEN. They are handsome and have an excellent performance. Sometimes, I will finish some dance cover of different K-POP songs. Although I am not a skillful dancer, it is interesting to have a performance with your best friends. Another favorite is ACG, which means Anime, Comics and Games. I started to watch my first anime, Detective Conan, when I am a primary student. The plots are usually dramatic and fruitful. If you like a character so much, it is nice to try to act as your loved character, which is cosplay actually.</p> 

<p>I have plenty of interests and favorites. Because of them, my life becomes more splendid and energetic. This is my life. Come and share with me.</p>

                                <p class="last"><p>Cosplay, a combination word of Costume Play, is a performance art that participants, also called Cosplayers, wear some specific costumes to mimic a character. It is popular, especially in Japan, Asia and Western Countries. The sources of those characters are usually from Anime, Comic and Games, sometimes it could be a real character from films and television series.</p>
                               
                                <p>I have been a cosplayer since December 2014. I love Cosplay because I love Anime and Comic at first. I have become an ACG lovers for almost 11 years. My first mimic character is Inga, from UN-GO. It is a soul killer which always seen in a form of young child. Cosplay brings me not only some fashion skills, such as sewing, hairdressing and makeup etc., but also friends with the same hobbits. I keep on representing different characters until today and I am willing to act more various characters in the future.</p>
